    <h1>KSHR</h1>
    
    <p>We're Mayank and Aman Kishore, brothers exploring the future. We've built robotic systems at Apple, improved NVIDIA's autonomous vehicle vision with simulation, and co-founded Mirage, which Harvey acquired.</p>
    
    <p>This is where we share our thoughts on AI, startups, and the future.</p>
    
    <h2>What We're Exploring</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Human-AI Interaction</strong>: How do we design AI systems that feel like natural extensions of human capability?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Post-SaaS Software</strong>: Companies building software that adapts to each customer rather than forcing everyone into the same mold.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Infrastructure for Intelligence</strong>: What needs to exist for truly capable AI systems to deploy and scale in the real world?</p>

    <p>We're always up for conversations about AI, startups, philosophy, or life. The future is too interesting to figure out alone.</p>
